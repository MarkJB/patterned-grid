# Generative Art Experiment
## Repeating patterned tiles in a grid

Experiment using ChatGPT (Started with GPT4, but ran up against the limits, wasn't perfect and needed some fixes, and there are some glitches that need addressing switched to GPT3.5, but that introduced a lot of problems so fixed manually).

Tiles consist of SVG arcs and lines or just lines. The tiles vary the direction of the lines (either vertical or horizontal) and then the whole tile is rotated at random and layed out in a grid.
